            <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
            <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out.
                 It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.
                  Cured meat adds a salty depth to the dish, and while guanciale is the most traditional choice, diced pancetta or bacon also work well.
                   Egg yolks give the carbonara sauce its luscious texture and golden hue, so pick up farm-fresh eggs if you can.
                    And when it comes to the cheese and pasta, this is the time to spend a little extra: Buy a wedge of Romano cheese or real Parmigiano Reggiano and a nice box of spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni.

                <li>300g Guanciale</li>
                <li>300g Pecorino cheese</li>
                <li>4 Large egg yolks</li>
                <li>2 Large whole eggs</li>
                <li>500g Spaghetti</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat water and add salt</li>
                <li>Cut guanciale and finely grate pecorino cheese</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs and yolk until no streaks remain,then add cheese in the mix</li>
                <li>Start cooking guanciale on medium heat,stirring occasionally,until crispy</li>
                <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
                <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
                <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>
                <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
