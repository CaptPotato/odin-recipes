            <h2>Eggs and bacon</h2>
            <p>My technique was learned from my mom, by watching her make our family's breakfast over and over again, year after year.  This is a basted eggs recipe which means the eggs are cooked in bacon grease. Cooking eggs in bacon fat is easy and takes just a little practice to perfect.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A loaf of your favorite bread</li>
                <li>Extra-large eggs, because you want a generous yolk.</li>
                <li>Your favorite bacon</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using a large skillet, place the slices of bacon in the pan over medium-high heat.  You don't want to crowd the bacon slices.</li>
                <li>If your bacon is spattering all over, the heat is too high.  Cook your bacon, turning it every couple of minutes until it reaches the crispiness you desire.</li>
                <li>Once all the bacon is cooked, turn your heat down to medium-low.  Don't drain the bacon fat.  You are going to fry your eggs in the bacon grease.</li>
                <li>Use a slotted spatula to remove the eggs from the pan and then blot each egg with a paper towel before putting it on the plate.  That way very little of the fat is actually served with the eggs.</li>
                <li>You want the bacon fat to be hot, but not so hot that the egg sizzles and crisps up around the edges.  I mean, I don't want my egg that way, but it's OK if you do.  Make your eggs how you want them.  That's the beauty of cooking at home.</li>
                <li>You'll want your toast to be in the slots of your toaster, ready to start toasting as soon as the eggs go into the frying pan.  The eggs should take about three minutes from pan to plate.</li>
                <li>Crack the eggs into the pan and start the toast in the toaster.  Let the eggs begin to cook for about 30-45 seconds.  Then using a large spoon, start to baste the eggs with the bacon fat by scooping the fat over the tops of the eggs.</li>
                <li>You are not going to flip these eggs.  The hot fat is going to cook the top of the eggs.  Be careful while spooning the fat over the eggs.  That bacon fat is hot!</li>
                <li>Using a slotted spatula, carefully lift each egg from the pan.  Holding a folded paper towel in your left hand (if you are a righty) blot the underside of the spatula to absorb any dripping fat and lightly blot the top of the egg.</li>
                
            </ol>
